Space Weather Monitor
The Space Weather Monitor project is designed to provide real-time updates on key space weather events and parameters. This application consolidates data related to solar flares, geomagnetic storms, interplanetary shocks, magnetopause crossings, and radiation belt enhancements. The goal is to offer a clear and organized interface for monitoring solar activity and its potential impact on space and Earth-based operations.

Features
Solar Flares: Displays the latest solar flare information, including class, time of occurrence, source location, and active region number.
Interplanetary Shocks: Lists the most recent interplanetary shocks detected with catalog and location information.
Magnetopause Crossing: Tracks the latest magnetopause crossings with instrument details and linked events.
Geomagnetic Storms: Provides updates on the most recent geomagnetic storms with Kp index and storm start time.
Radiation Belt: Shows the latest enhancements in the radiation belts, including event times and instrumentation details.
Picture of the Day: Displays a button to showcase a picture related to space weather or solar phenomena.
Overview
The Space Weather Monitor aggregates space weather events in a visually structured dashboard, making it easy for users to access and understand critical space weather information. The data focuses on events that can impact satellite operations, communication systems, and other space-based activities.
